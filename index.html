  <h3>A Visualization of Campaign Contributions for the 2016 Presidential Election</h3>

      <div>
        <h3>Some Header</h3>
        There are massive amounts of money in politics. $273.1 million have already been given to candidates (through September 2015)
      </div>
      <div>
        That's 4 times the budget of the Federal Election Committee, the government organization that regulars campaigns, for <i>all</i> of 2015
      </div>

    <div>
        <h3>A Historic Election</h3>
        The 2016 election is on track to be the most funded presidential election in history. <br><br>
        When the fundraising from this election is compared to that of 2012...
        
      </div>
      <div>
        ...the difference is staggering.<br><br>
        Campaigns have already raised almost double the amount of money compared to this point in the 2012 campaign. Candidates are on track to raise around $2 Billion dollars by election day.<br><br>
        With all of this money in the election, which candidates are drawing the most donations?
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Donation Inequality</h3>
        Just as massive amounts of money have been poured into this election, massive amounts of money have been poured into Hillary Clinton's campaign.
      </div>


      <div>
        In fact, Clinton's campaign received more money from individual donors through the end of September 2015 than the bottom 16 candidates ...
      </div>


      <div>
        ...combined.
      </div>


      <div>
        Even when you add in other contributions...
      </div>


      <div>
        ...like the candidates' own money<br>
        (mostly from Donald Trump)...
      </div>


      <div>
        ...and money from PACs...<br>
        <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=='none'){document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=''}else{document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display='none'}" style="font-size: 9px; color: grey;">Wondering why these numbers are so small?</a>

        <div id="spoiler" style="display:none; font-size: 9px;">
          <br>
          These PACs aren't the same a Super PACs. Super PACs do spend large amounts of money on elections, but cannot give directly to candidates. Regular PACs, shown here, have donation restrictions because they can give directly to candidates
        </div>
      </div>


      <div>
        ...Clinton <i>still</i> has significantly more than all other candidates.<br>
        <br>
        But where does this disparity come from?
      </div>


      <div>
        <h3>A Party Divided</h3>
          Despite Clinton's massive funding, Republican candidates actually have the upper hand.
      </div>
      <div>
        When the scale is adjusted to make everything fit...
      </div>
      <div>
        ...and the candidates funds are add up by party...
      </div>
      <div>
        ...more money has actually gone to Republicans than Democrats. 
      </div>
    </div>

        <h3>Scroll away</h3>
        As the bottom of the container approaches the top of the page, the graph is classed with <span class='mono'>graph-scroll-below</span>. A little more css allows the graph slide out of view gracefully:

        <pre>
  #graph.graph-scroll-below{
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0px;
    margin-left: 240px;
  }
</pre>
